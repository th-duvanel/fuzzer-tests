FuzzerMain invokes FuzzerDriver with TestOneInput
FuzzerLoop
ChooseUnitIdxToMutate gives weights to the unit (which is essentially a range)
to be mutated. MD (Mutation Dispatcher). Units to be mutated are selected based
on which is the most recent

Units are vectors of bytes and the corpus is a vector of Unite
EXT_FUNC(LLVMFuzzerInitialize, int, (int *argc, char ***argv), false);

RecordMax records data to a max coverage tracker and returns true if additional
coverage is discovered.

All of these declare if coverage increased

    |--updateMaxCoverage
        |--RecordMax

FindExtraUnits runs RunOne once for each unit, calculates the whole coverage,
then only adds back the units that add to the coverage.
