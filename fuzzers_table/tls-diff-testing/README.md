# Explanation about generate_multi.sh and stimulator.cpp
You can see in this folder two files: the generate_multi and stimulator. They are part of the tls-diff fuzzer. But why are they here to be copied and used to replace the same binaries in the original repo? That's simple: TLS-Diff is made to connect in specific port servers, which are more than one. The own fuzzer builds them, with tls-server-batch. This explains the stimulator.cpp, that has changes on the port variable in line 217, which is fixed to 4433 (TLS standard).
On the other side, generate_multi is changed to produce less messages than its original. In the original fuzzer, 10 x 100000 messages are generated, and takes a long time. In our implementation, we changed the variables to 10 x 10, to simplify the process. Although tls-diff takes much long time than the others, the explanation is here.
